# chef-ohai-plugins

When using Chef to manage your infrastructure, you may find that you need some
detailed information about the current state of machine's applications.  You
might also find that you'd like to be able to collect and analyse such data; for
example, one might want to list all the servers with a specific version of an
application.

When you are working with servers that have SAP systems installed, you may want
additional information about those systems, like their system IDs.

This repo contains custom ohai plugins to do just that; collect information
about installed applications and SAP systems.

[Ohai](https://docs.chef.io/ohai.html) is a tool that is used to collect system
configuration data, which is provided to the Chef Infra Client for use within
cookbooks. Ohai is run by the Chef Infra Client at the beginning of every Chef
run to determine system state.

[Chef Infra](https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview.html) is a powerful automation
platform that transforms infrastructure into code. Whether youâ€™re operating in
the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, Chef automates how
infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no
matter its size.

## Requirements

These plugins are for use with ohai.
[Ohai](https://rubygems.org/gems/ohai/versions/14.8.11) _can_ be installed
standalone, however it is more common that you'll use this as a part of the
[Chef Infra Client](https://downloads.chef.io/).

## Download and Installation

We've laid out this repo as a cookbook, so that you can use it to install the
plugins. If you'd like to distribute them manually, you'll find the plugins in
the root of the `/files/` directory.

1. Simply put the desired ohai plugins in your system's ohai directory
1. Use the Chef [ohai](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ohai) cookbook to
install the plugins
1. Use this cookbook to install the plugins

## Available Plugins

### sap_sid

Not a BASIS consultant? Do not worry! This custom Ohai plugin will retrieve
every hidden detail of an SAP system installation.

Give it a try, by running `>ohai -d ./files/ sap`

`sap_sid` exposes:

*NOTE*: Chef 14 includes `node['packages']` which provides _basic_ information
about the applications and packages. This is designed to give more details.
